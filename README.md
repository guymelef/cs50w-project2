# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## FLACK
A Flask chat app written in Python and Javascript. Live at (Google Chrome preferred): https://flack4cs50w.herokuapp.com/

### DESCRIPTION
This web app is written in vanilla CSS and JS.

It uses the client's `localStorage` together with Flask global variables to store credentials. Flask's session variable was not used for this app.

Users can sign in with no password, just with a unique display name. Channel creation is also possible.

As a *personal touch*, a **file upload** feature is added. File upload is limited to jpg/jpeg, png, gif, pdf, and txt files with a maximum size of 2MB.
